-> small town somewhere
=== small town ===
It's the morning of a warm summer breeze rushes over you as an aroma of grass and flowers runs past your nose. 
The village people start to come out of their homes and gather in the town square. You live in a small town of about 300 people. 
Mr. Summers greets you:
"Good Morning..."
+ Bill Hutchinson! What wonderful weather!
  "Good Morning Mr. Summers.
+ Terrie Hutchinson! What a perfect day!
  "I wouldn't say it is a perfect day.
You gather with your family and spouse. The rest of the town also gathers in groups based off of their families. 
The lottery is a dying tradition but your town still does it. Mr. Summers walks to the front of the line with the black box. 
+ Run. You know you can't raise your family with this tradition.
+ Stay. You don't want to risk your children getting picked.
